# üåå Phase-Field Fracture Demo (AT1/AT2) ‚Äì FEniCS

This repository provides a simple demonstration of the **phase-field fracture model** (AT1 and AT2 formulations) implemented in the **open-source FEA library [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/)**.  

The implementation is **general**, avoids the history energy formulation, and uses the **SNES nonlinear solver** to enforce **irreversibility constraints**.  
It is designed as a reference and learning tool for researchers interested in phase-field modeling of fracture using FEniCS.
