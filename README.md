# Phase-Field-Fenics-AT1-Model-demo
This is a simple AT1/AT2 model implementation of the popular phase-field model in open source FEA software, Fenics. The implementation is general and covers both the AT1/AT2 model without evoking history energy formulation and using the SNES solver to constrain irreversibility. Hope it helps someone!
